Hello Hackers!!

I am an undergrad student pursuing my bachelorâ€™s in computer science and engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, India.

I have been a member of [teambi0s](https://twitter.com/teambi0s) since 2018.

My area of focus is Digital Forensics and I have been working in this for the last 2 years.

I have planed to use this blog for my further work. Some of my older posts can be found in
